This project was made for an earlier version of Android than exists now, so be sure to check the Java and Android versions before using. I did update it when I downloaded Android Studio version 1.5, so there shouldn't be any issues when trying to open it. I created all of the images myself using Photoshop, and would prefer one to ask permission if they'd like to use any in their own project, though they shouldn't be difficult to duplicate if one attempted.

Note: Lining up the text for the player labels and values was definitely not done properly, and is dependent on the phone you are using. The only device I made this for was a Samsung Galaxy S5, so it lines up perfectly for that screen resolution. I would love to hear how to fix this, as positioning elements has always been annoying for me. That's why when I create web pages I use percentages to align things, rather than strict values.
